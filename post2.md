## Welcome, Rayne!

**Hello, my name is Rayne, and I've recently started at Christopher James in Bramhall!**

I’m very excited to have started here even if these are strange times for us all!

I’m really enjoying being in the shop and look forward to meeting all the existing and new customers who have been so lovely and welcoming.

A little bit about myself, I’m trained to Level 3 NVQ Barbering and have been doing barbering for 10 years now! I’ve also got my Barbercide certificate.

Look forward to meeting you all! 

Rayne
