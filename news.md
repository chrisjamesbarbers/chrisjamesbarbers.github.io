## We're opening again on Monday 12th April !

Hi Everybody,


I hope you're all keeping safe and well through this 2nd long lockdown - it's been a tough time for all concerned but everbody's health is at the forefront of everything - even with long hair! 


As you know we will, all being well, be opening on Monday 12th april and Rayne and I are really loocking forward to starting again and seeing you all safe and well. 


As with the previous lockdowns, all those people who had a pre-existing appointments booked with us both in January and Febuary 2021 will be contacted first to rebook. Then we will be at the barbers on Monday 5th, Tuesday 6th, Friday 9th and Saturday 10th April between 11-30am to 2-30pm where you can contact us by phone or call in to see us and book on our list. 


Both myself and Rayne would like to send our best wishes to you all and to thank you all so much for your fantastic and continued support through a difficult time for everyone! 


Look forward to catching up!


Kindest wishes, Chris and Rayne x
