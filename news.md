## We're opening again on Monday 12th April !

Hi Everybody,


We hope you have all stayed safe through this long 3 months 2nd lockdown?


All being well we will be reopening Christopher James Barbers again on Monday 12th april when myself and Rayne are so looking forward to seeing all our fantastic loyal clients again. 


As in the previous long closure we are, as you understand, going to be extremely busy and we will endeavour to get round to seeing to all you long hair gentlemen. But once again out of courtesy could you all kindly exercise some patience and we will all get through this busy period together.


As before, those clients who had pre-existing appointments will be contacted from Tuesday 6th April unless already contacted earlier. Then all other free appointment spaces left will be booked in on first come basis. You can contact both myself and Rayne on Tuesday 6th, Friday 9th and Saturday 10th April from 11.30am to 2pm. 

Once again, thanks for your fantastic and continued support in what has been a dreadful time for all of us. 


Kindest wishes always, Chris and Rayne
